Please read the following instructions for running the library website smoothly in your computer.


1. Download AMPPS(recommended), or XAMPPS, or a similar application that runs PHP and MySQL.

2. After installing the AMPPS make sure the PHP and MySQL are running. If not please install any SQL like Postgresql or MongoDB.

3. log in to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/  ("root" is the username and "MySQL" is usually the password)

4. Go to the AMPPS folder (where you downloaded it, most likely in local disk C) and go to the folder www. Unzip the file in the www folder.

5. Please make sure to do an extract here. Do not keep the files in a folder, we have set directories, and keeping the files in a folder won't work. Doing an "extract here" should make it run.

6. Copy the whole code from library.sql and paste it into the SQL section after going to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

7. Now open the AMPPS and open the localhost root directory(the globe icon for AMPPS) and it will take you to the login page.

8. As we have dummy data please check the username, password, and roles from the user table in the SQL file.

9. You can now navigate through our library website.
